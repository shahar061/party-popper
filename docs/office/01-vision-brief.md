# Vision Brief: Party Popper

## The Problem
Board games like Hitster are fun but require physical components (cards, tokens) and have a fixed song library. Families and friend groups want a music quiz experience that is easy to set up, works with any screen, and can be played with songs they actually know and love.

## The Vision
A digital music timeline game that turns any gathering into a music trivia showdown. Two teams compete to build a timeline of songs by guessing artist, song name, and release year. The game runs on a shared screen (TV/laptop) while each player uses their phone. Music plays through Spotify via QR code deeplinks, keeping it legal and leveraging music people already have access to. The tension builds as teams can challenge each other with veto tokens, and the first team to 10 songs wins.

## Target Users
- **Families** gathering for holidays, birthdays, or casual evenings
- **Friend groups** hosting game nights or parties
- Ages spanning multiple generations (the game can include music from various decades)
- Users who have Spotify accounts (at least one person per session)

## Core Value Proposition
- **No physical components** - just phones and a screen
- **Legal music playback** - Spotify deeplinks mean no licensing issues
- **Flexible song selection** - play with curated classics or create custom playlists
- **Interactive competition** - veto system adds strategic depth beyond simple trivia

## Key Capabilities
1. **Web host display** - shows game state, QR codes for songs, team timelines (castable to TV)
2. **Mobile player interface** - join game, answer questions, place songs on timeline, use veto tokens
3. **Team-based gameplay** - 2 teams, turn-based with interactive veto mechanic
4. **Spotify integration via QR deeplinks** - opens songs directly in user's Spotify app
5. **Two game modes** - Classic (curated 100-song pool) and Custom (user-created playlists)

## Success Criteria
- A complete game can be played from start to finish (first team to 10 songs)
- Both Classic and Custom modes work
- QR code deeplinks successfully open songs in Spotify
- Veto/token system functions correctly
- Tiebreaker round resolves ties
- Game is playable by 4+ people (2+ per team)

## Open Questions
- What decades/genres should the initial 100-song curated pool cover?
- Should there be a minimum/maximum team size?
- Will Custom mode allow importing Spotify playlists directly, or manual song entry?
- Is there a need for user accounts, or is it purely session-based?
- Future monetization (free with ads, premium features, one-time purchase)?
